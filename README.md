This app uses firebase database in order to keep track of users on google map(making constant location updates). Users are displayed with custom photo & name markers. Firebase is also used for the login, sign up and image storage of users. The app follows MVP architecture. 

Users have the ability to adjust their visibility and edit their profile and all changes take place in real time. Users also have the ability to communicate with each other, view and share each other's info and get directions to each other's location.
